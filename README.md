## Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. You can configure your config using one of the following methods:

    1. **Using the Setup Script:**
      - For Windows, run the following npm script from the project root:
        ```bash
        npm run setup:windows
        ```
      - For Linux, use this command:
        ```bash
        npm run setup:linux
        ```
      - These commands will automatically open your default web browser to help you configure your settings through a web-based interface.

    2. **Manual Configuration:**
      - Copy the `default.config.json5` file to create a `config.json5` file:
        ```bash
        cp default.config.json5 config.json5
        ```
      - Open `config.json5` and update it with your application's configuration settings.

4. Follow the instructions in the `default.config.json5` or `config.json5` file.
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Cache File Location

After running the application for the first time, a cache file will be automatically created at:
```
./data/cache.json
```

This file stores temporary data to improve performance and reduce API calls. The `data/` directory structure will look like this:
```
project-root/
├── data/
│   ├── cache.json    # Auto-generated cache file
│   └── README.md     # Cache documentation
├── logs/             # Application logs (if logging is enabled)
├── config.json5      # Your configuration file
└── ...
```

**Important Notes:**
- The cache file is automatically managed by the application
- Do not manually edit the cache file
- The cache file will be recreated if deleted
- You can safely delete the cache file to reset cached data
- The `data/` directory must be writable by the application

## Migration

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using this project since the `config.js` file or `config.jsonc` and you're updating to the latest version, please run the following command to migrate your configuration to the new format.

```bash
npm run migrate
```

or

```bash
node convert.js
```

## Usage
For a detailed usage guide, refer to this gist: [Cookie Guide](https://gist.github.com/torikushiii/59eff33fc8ea89dbc0b2e7652db9d3fd).

## Notifications Setup
For setting up Discord or Telegram notifications, refer to the [setup folder](https://github.com/torikushiii/hoyolab-auto/tree/main/setup).

## Running with Docker

This application can be easily managed and run using Docker. We provide a Makefile 
for convenience, but you can also use Docker commands directly.

**1. Prerequisites**

- **Docker:**  Ensure Docker is installed and running. Download it from [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/).
- **Docker Compose:** Most Docker installations include Docker Compose. If not, install it from [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

**2. Configuration**

You can configure your config using one of the following methods:

1. **Using the Setup Script:**
   - For Windows, run the following npm script from the project root:
     ```bash
     npm run setup:windows
     ```
   - For Linux, use this command:
     ```bash
     npm run setup:linux
     ```
   - These commands will automatically open your default web browser to help you configure your settings through a web-based interface.

2. **Manual Configuration:**
   - Copy the `default.config.json5` file to create a `config.json5` file:
     ```bash
     cp default.config.json5 config.json5
     ```
   - Open `config.json5` and update it with your application's configuration settings.
   - Set environment variable `CONFIG_PATH` to alter the configuration file path (default to `./config.json5`).

**Important for Docker Users:**
> [!NOTE]
> When running with Docker, the cache file will be created inside the container at `/app/data/cache.json`. To persist cache data between container restarts, ensure the `data` directory is properly mounted as a volume (this is already configured in the provided `docker-compose.yml`).
> If this is your first time running docker:
> - Make sure your user is listed in the docker group, you can do so by running `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`, logging out and back in
> - From the project root, grant yourself perms to not have errors while accessing certain folders such as `data`. We can fix this by running `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER data logs && chmod -R 777 data logs`

**3. Building and Running with Docker Compose**

**Using the Makefile (Recommended):**

The provided Makefile simplifies common Docker tasks. 

- **Build the image:**
  ```bash
  make build 
  ``` 
- **Start the application:**
  ```bash
  make up
  ```
- **Stop the application:**
  ```bash
  make down
  ```
- **View logs:**
  ```bash
  make logs 
  ```
- **Rebuild and restart:**
  ```bash
  make update 
  ```
  
  For a complete list of available Makefile targets, run:

  ```bash
  make help
  ```

**Using Docker Compose Directly:**

If you prefer not to use the Makefile, you can use the following Docker Compose commands:

- **Build the image:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose build
  ```
- **Start the application:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
- **Stop the application:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```
- **View logs:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f instance
  ```
- **Rebuild and restart:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose down && docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
  ```
